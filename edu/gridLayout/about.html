            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                As a household name, Google focuses on its cultural impact to engage readers on its About Us page, which is dynamically updated with new content (the section at the bottom is updated with its daily doodle).
                For example, when I began writing this article (January 2024), the page highlighted its 25 Years In Search video. Only a week later, it switched to a Doodle contest for children to earn scholarships and tech for schools.
                Google wraps up the page with case studies of people utilizing its tech for the betterment of its communities, furthering its already evident corporate social responsibility and global impact.
