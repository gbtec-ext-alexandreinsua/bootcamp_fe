      <h2>Anything suspicious?</h2>

      <p>
        Well... then should we go? Any uh... Cartel news these days? Seems like
        I'm always reading something or other in the paper. I don't want to talk
        about it. To you or anyone else. I'm done explaining myself. Gus is
        dead. We've got work to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesse Jackson? Do you even... ah, I see you have a telephone at least.
        You know that blinking thing I've been calling you on? I will break
        this, I will BREAK THIS. Damn druggie idiot. Is this what you've been
        doing the whole time I've been trying to reach you? The game has
        changed. The word is out. And you... are a killer. Apparently it's all
        over town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somebody crossed you, you got angry, you crushed their skull with an ATM
        machine. Who cares! Just as long as it's our competitors who believe it
        and not the police. Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a...
        Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but
        the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the
        blowfish do, Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up,
        okay? The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal
        and why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's
        why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's
        you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see
        it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the blowfish,
        Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like
        you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH!
