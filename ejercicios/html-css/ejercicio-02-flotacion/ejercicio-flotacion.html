      A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
      and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
      bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in
      the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my
      talents.
    </p>

    <p>
      I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
      and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

    <p>
      When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
      meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my
      trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I
      throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as
      I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me:
      when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow
      familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and
      flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his
      own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and
      sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then,
      my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem
      to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved
      mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe
      these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full
      and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul
      is the mirror of the infinite God!
    </p>

    <p>
      O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the
      weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken
      possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which
      I enjoy with my whole heart.
