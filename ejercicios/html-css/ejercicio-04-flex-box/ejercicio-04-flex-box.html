            <h2>Wonderful serenity</h2>
            <p>
              A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
              these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
              I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which
              was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my
              dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
              existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
              drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that
              I never was a greater artist than now.

              didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place
              with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as
              he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back

              I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would 
              be the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think

              up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything
              I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk!

            <h2>Visions</h2>
            <p>
              When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
              meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage
              of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
              sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the
              trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
              unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
              little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the
              countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
              feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image,
              and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us,
              as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my
              friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth
              seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a
              beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I
              could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all
              that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the
              mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O
              my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under
              the weight of the splendour of these visions!
